# NULL Values - Business Meaning Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a detailed analysis of what each NULL value means in each column of our loan data pipeline. The key question is: **Does the missing data affect analysis, or does it simply mean the field doesn't apply?**

## NULL Classification by Business Meaning

### ðŸ”´ MISSING DATA (Data Quality Issue)
- **Definition**: NULLs that indicate missing information that should be present
- **Business Impact**: **AFFECTS ANALYSIS** - Cannot make informed decisions
- **Examples**: Credit Score, Annual Income, Years of Credit History

### âœ… NOT APPLICABLE (Positive Indicator)
- **Definition**: NULLs that indicate the field doesn't apply (good news)
- **Business Impact**: **POSITIVE** - Indicates clean history or no issues
- **Examples**: Months since last delinquent, Bankruptcies, Tax Liens

### ðŸŸ  UNKNOWN STATUS (Neutral)
- **Definition**: NULLs that indicate unknown status, neither good nor bad
- **Business Impact**: **NEUTRAL** - Doesn't affect analysis significantly
- **Examples**: Home Ownership, Maximum Open Credit

### ðŸ”µ ZERO VALUE (No Activity)
- **Definition**: NULLs that likely mean zero or no activity
- **Business Impact**: **NEUTRAL** - Usually means no debt or no activity
- **Examples**: Monthly Debt, Current Credit Balance

## Technical Implementation

### SQL Examples for NULL Handling

```sql
-- Example: Credit Score categorization
CASE 
    WHEN credit_score IS NULL THEN 'No Credit History'
    WHEN credit_score < 580 THEN 'Poor'
    WHEN credit_score < 670 THEN 'Fair'
    WHEN credit_score < 740 THEN 'Good'
    ELSE 'Excellent'
END as credit_score_category

-- Example: Positive NULL indicators
CASE 
    WHEN months_since_last_delinquent IS NULL THEN 'Clean History'
    WHEN months_since_last_delinquent > 24 THEN 'Good Standing'
    ELSE 'Recent Issues'
END as payment_history_category

-- Example: Risk assessment with NULLs
CASE 
    WHEN annual_income IS NULL AND job_tenure_years IS NULL THEN 'High Risk - No Income Data'
    WHEN annual_income IS NULL THEN 'Medium Risk - Income Missing'
    WHEN job_tenure_years IS NULL THEN 'Medium Risk - Employment Unknown'
    ELSE 'Standard Risk Assessment'
END as risk_category
```

### dbt Tests for NULL Validation

```yaml
# Example dbt tests
- name: critical_fields_not_null
  description: "Critical fields should not be NULL"
  tests:
    - not_null:
        where: "loan_status IS NOT NULL"

- name: positive_nulls_validation
  description: "Validate positive NULL patterns"
  tests:
    - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
        expression: "months_since_last_delinquent IS NULL OR months_since_last_delinquent >= 0"

- name: null_pattern_consistency
  description: "Check NULL pattern consistency"
  tests:
    - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
        expression: "(annual_income IS NULL AND job_tenure_years IS NULL) OR (annual_income IS NOT NULL OR job_tenure_years IS NOT NULL)"
```

## Summary
