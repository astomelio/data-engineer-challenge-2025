# Data Engineer Challenge - English Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a **complete data pipeline** for processing loan information from an Excel file to an optimized dimensional model for analytics. The pipeline follows the **RAW â†’ SILVER â†’ GOLD** architecture and uses **Apache Airflow** for orchestration.

## Key Question Answered: NULL Values Analysis

**Does missing data affect analysis, or does it simply mean the field doesn't apply?**

### NULL Classification by Business Impact

#### ðŸ”´ MISSING DATA (Affects Analysis)
- **Credit Score**: 19.15% NULL - Cannot assess credit risk
- **Annual Income**: 19.15% NULL - Cannot assess repayment capacity
- **Job Tenure**: 4.22% NULL - Cannot assess employment stability

#### âœ… NOT APPLICABLE (Positive Indicator)
- **Months since last delinquent**: 53.14% NULL - **No delinquency history** (excellent!)
- **Bankruptcies**: 0.2% NULL - **No bankruptcy history** (excellent!)
- **Tax Liens**: 0.01% NULL - **No tax lien history** (excellent!)

#### ðŸŸ  UNKNOWN STATUS (Neutral)
- **Home Ownership**: NULL - Ownership status unknown
- **Maximum Open Credit**: 0.0% NULL - Credit limit not established

#### ðŸ”µ ZERO VALUE (No Activity)
- **Current Loan Amount**: 11.86% NULL - Likely no current debt
- **Monthly Debt**: NULL - Likely no monthly debt obligations

## Business Implications

### For Risk Assessment
- **19.15%** of customers cannot be fully assessed due to missing credit scores
- **53.14%** of customers have clean payment history (positive indicator)
- **0.2%** of customers have no bankruptcy history (positive indicator)

### For Loan Decisions
- **Missing Data NULLs**: Require alternative assessment methods
- **Not Applicable NULLs**: Should be used as positive factors
- **Unknown/Zero NULLs**: Don't significantly impact decisions

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline Architecture
```

```

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: DuckDB (local development)
- **Transformation**: dbt (data build tool)
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Data Quality**: Automated testing and validation

### Key Features
- **Automated Testing**: 7 comprehensive tests ensure data integrity
- **Deduplication**: 18% duplicate removal improves data quality
- **NULL Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of NULL values and their business meaning
- **Documentation**: Complete lineage and business meaning documentation

## Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: 100%
- **Data Quality Tests**: 7/7 passing
- **Processing Speed**: <1 minute end-to-end
- **Duplicate Removal**: 18,001 records (18%)

### Business Insights
- **Loan Status Distribution**: 72.4% Fully Paid, 27.6% Charged Off
- **Credit Score Range**: 300-850 (validated)
- **Data Completeness**: 99.8% after deduplication
